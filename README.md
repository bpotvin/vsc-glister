# vsc-glister

glister theme

This utterly minimalist theme is titled after a line at the end of one of my favorite poems, 

*From hence, ye beauties, undeceiv'd,<br>
Know, one false step is ne'er retriev'd,<br>
And be with caution bold. <br>
Not all that tempts your wandering eyes <br>
And heedless hearts, is lawful prize; <br>
Nor all, that glisters, gold.<br>
 \-Thomas Grey*
